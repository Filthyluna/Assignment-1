        The rusty-spotted cat, also known as Prionailurus rubiginosus, is one of the cat family's smallest members, of which
        historical records are known only from India and Sri Lanka.
        In 2012, it was also recorded in the western Terai of Nepal. Since 2016, the global wild population is listed as
        Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List as it is fragmented
        and affected by loss and destruction of its prime habitat, deciduous forests. These cats are keen carnivores despite
        their size and often eat birds, lizards, and even insects.
        This cat can often be mistaken for a house cat or kitten due to its size and domestic appearance.
