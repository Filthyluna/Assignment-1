        The reef squid is a colorful torpedo shaped squid often found in the caribbean waters and even the coast of Florida.
        They are unique
        as their habitat changes depending on the stage of their life cycle. When they are first born they are found in
        turtle grass and later
        go on to explore the open waters. Sometimes these squid are found deep in the sea with recorded depths up to 150
        metres. They are also the
        most spotted squid species and are not afraid to say hi to divers.
