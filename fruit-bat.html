      Fruit bats, also known as megabats or ptreopodids are a species of bats that are known to eat fruit and are quite
      large in size.
      Among the best-known pteropodids are the flying foxes (Pteropus), found on tropical islands from Madagascar to
      Australia and Indonesia which have lengths
      similar to medium sized dogs or cats.
      They are the largest of all bats. Some of the smallest members of the family are the pollen- and nectar-eating
      long-tongued fruit bats (Macroglossus),
      which attain a head and body length of about 6–7 cm (2.4–2.8 inches) and a wingspan of about 25 cm (10 inches).
      Colour varies among the pteropodids; some are red or yellow,
      some striped or spotted.
      With the exception of rousette bats (Rousettus), Old World fruit bats rely on vision rather than echolocation
      (animal “sonar”) as a means of avoiding obstacles.
